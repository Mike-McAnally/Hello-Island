The Island is a "virtual reality space" that only exists electronically as ones and zeros, <a href="https://rocketvirtual.com/TheIsland.html" >yet you can still visit it</a>!  Currently it is manifest through Three.js and A-frame version 1.0.1 WebXR technology. If no VR headset, use keyboard arrow keys and mouse drag to move around.

You can find more of my VR projects at the <a href="https://rocketvirtual.com/">blog</a>.
